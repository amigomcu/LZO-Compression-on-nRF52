# LZO-Compression-on-nRF52

## Show how to use the LZO compression / decompression library on nRF52 Series

This demo is to add the miniLZO compression / decompression library on the nRF52 series.

miniLZO is a very lightweight subset of the LZO library intended for easy inclusion with your application. It is generated automatically from the LZO source code and contains the most important LZO functions.

Very easy to use - it only takes a few minutes to add data compression to your application!


## Requirement

Nordic SDK 15.3 

Softdevice : S132v6.1.1 / S140v6.1.1

HW: NRF52832 DK / NRF52840 DK


## Note

The project may need modifications to work with later versions or other boards. To compile it, clone the repository in the /nRF5_SDK_15.3.0/examples/ directory. The application is built to be used with the official nRF5 SDK that can be downloaded from developer.nordicsemi.com
